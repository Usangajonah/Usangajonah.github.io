						class="image fit"><img src="images/ec.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>This project is about an E-commerce company that that sells clothing online but they also have
						in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers sometimes order on a mobile app or
						website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their effort
						on their Mobile App experience or their website. In this project, I created an algorithm using
						Python which makes prediction to help them solve that problem.</p>

					<p>For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club
						connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as
						an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability
						of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.</p>

					<p>Like we all know that emergency is an unforeseen or sudden occurrence which demand immediate
						remedy or action. At some point, we tend to think more about why some emergency calls are been
						made and that’s the main reason I have decided to perform some analysis on the 911 calls
						dataset. For this project I will be analysing some 911 (emergency calls) data from Kaggle in
						Montgomert County Pennsylvania. </p>

					<p>The dashboard presented paints a concerning a company's performance over a 26-month period. Both
						revenue and earnings fell short of targets, indicating a need for immediate corrective action.
						While the detailed breakdowns of product sales and return rates provide some insight, further
						interaction is crucial to identify the root causes of these shortcomings. Addressing these
						issues promptly is essential to ensure the company's financial stability and future success.</p>

					<p>This dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of a company's employee information, most likely
						intended for the Human Resources department. It provides a snapshot of key metrics such as
						headcount, salary expenditure, demographics, and performance. With 67% of the workforce
						currently active, it's important to understand the reasons behind the remaining inactive
						employees. The breakdown of salary expenditure and employee demographics by gender and marital
						status offers valuable insights into workforce composition. Additionally, the performance rating
						distribution helps identify areas where employee development or recognition programs might be
						beneficial. This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for HR professionals to monitor workforce
						trends and make informed decisions.</p>
